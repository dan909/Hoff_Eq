# Hoff Equation Calculator App
The Hoff Equation Calculator is a Python Tkinter application that allows users to calculate properties related to the Hoff equation. 
The Hoff equation is used in thermodynamics to determine the work of an ideal gas in a reversible isothermal expansion or compression process.
This takes either the molarity or the Water potential and calculates the other based on the temperature and pressure.

## Other inputs
Temperature: Users can input the temperature in Celsius, Kelvin, or Fahrenheit.
Pressure: The app warns users if they are not using the default pressure constant (0.0831 atm·L/mol·K or 8.314 J/mol·K).
ion (number of ions): The number of moles of ions involved in the chemical reaction. It represents the stoichiometric coefficient of the ions in the balanced chemical equation for the process under consideration.

## How to Use
Run the Python script to launch the Tkinter GUI.
Enter the number of ions, pressure, temperature, and either molarity or work potential in their respective input boxes.
Select the temperature (Celsius, Kelvin, or Fahrenheit) and pressure units (L·atm/mol·K or J/mol·K) from the dropdown menu.
Click the "Calculate" button to obtain the calculated results.
The app will display the relevant property based on the chosen calculation option.

## Requirements
Python 3.x
Tkinter library (should be included)
